2018 CitiBike Analysis

When analyzing the data for CitiBike for 2018, the following phenomenons were observed:

1. May through October are the most popular months for all user types, however even though the number of trips taken each month stays fairly consistent, the number of miles traveled begins to decline drastically from June through October. Is this decrease in mileage caused by changing weather conditions (too hot followed by too cold) or is it cause by a decrease in daylight hours?

2. Looking at monthly ride start times classified by gender, the majority of customers (24-hour and 3-day pass purchasers) do not select a gender when beginning their ride. When you include birth years, all of the customers who did not select a gender chose 1960-69 as their birth year. Do riders in this age group not want to share too much of their personal information. It was also noted that female riders make up a small percentage of subscribers for CitiBike. This could stem from a female rider not feeling safe out in the open, possibly on their own, in NYC. Another anomaly that was observed where birth years selected dating back to 1880? CitiBike may want to limit birth years to a reasonable range, back to 1940, and require gender classification (perhaps with added non-traditional categories) to better track rider data.

3. When looking at year-round peak hours, it was unusual to see that subscriber usage was at its highest during the winter months when customer usage was at its lowest. Could this mean that people living in New York are more likely to use the service when there are less tourists? It was also interesting to note that no matter the time of year, subscribers were consistently using the service from 6:00 AM until 11:00 PM. Where customers were using the service during the more typical business/tourist hours of 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
